GoodLabels/fixedagain.json is the corrected ground truth data for Data_Training image set provided by Lockheed Martin and HeroX.
GoodLabels/output.json is the corrected ground truth data for Data_LeaderboardTesting image set provided by Lockheed Martin and HeroX.

logs is where the neural network (MaskRCNN stores the most updated models and tensorboard data). The current best model that was used
in our submission was logs/gate20190309T0611/mask_rcnn_gate_0371.h5

starterscripts are additions to the template files provided by AlphaPilot. It also contains our actual submission zip file. Run generate_results.py to predict a gate.

Program.cs is a CSharp program created to parse the original json files into vgg format that MaskRCNN can read.

gate.py is what is used to train the MaskRCNN model. 

requirements.txt contains the necessary pip packages to run the code.

vggFormatTrain.json and vggFormatVal.json are the training and validation sets that the MaskRCNN actually trained on. They are generated by Program.cs from GoodLabels/
